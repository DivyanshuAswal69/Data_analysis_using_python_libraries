The main objective of this project is to use Pandas and Seaborn to explore the dataset and to gain insights.
Python Data Analysis using Pandas and Seaborn
This is a brief guide to using Python, specifically the Pandas and Seaborn libraries, for data analysis.

Introduction:-
Python is a popular programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more. The Pandas library is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, while Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that allows for easy creation of attractive and informative visualizations.

Installation:-
Both Pandas and Seaborn can be installed using pip, a package manager for Python. Simply run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pandas
pip install seaborn

Once you have installed Pandas and Seaborn, you can import them into your Python script using the following commands:

(Recommended IDE : Jupyter Notebook)

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

The first step in data analysis is usually to load your data into a Pandas DataFrame. Pandas can handle a variety of data formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.

Here is an example of loading a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame:


df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

Once you have loaded your data into a Pandas DataFrame, you can start exploring it. Here are some common DataFrame operations:

df.head(): Returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
df.tail(): Returns the last 5 rows of the DataFrame
df.info(): Displays information about the DataFrame, including data types and missing values
df.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the DataFrame

Data Cleaning:

Data cleaning is an important step in data analysis. Here are some common data cleaning tasks:

Removing duplicates: df.drop_duplicates()
Removing missing values: df.dropna()
Filling missing values: df.fillna(value)
Renaming columns: df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'})
Changing data types: df.astype({'column_name': 'new_data_type'})

Data Visualization:

Seaborn makes it easy to create beautiful visualizations. Here are some common Seaborn visualizations:

Scatter plot: sns.scatterplot(x='column1', y='column2', data=df)
Line plot: sns.lineplot(x='column1', y='column2', data=df)
Bar plot: sns.barplot(x='column1', y='column2', data=df)
Histogram: sns.histplot(x='column', data=df)
Heatmap: sns.heatmap(data=df.corr())

Conclusion:
Python, Pandas, and Seaborn are powerful tools for data analysis and visualization. With the knowledge and skills outlined in this guide, you should be able to start exploring and analyzing your own data sets.
